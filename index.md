August Guang. PhD Candidate in Applied Mathematics and Computational Molecular Biology at Brown University. I study probability theory and phylogenetics, specifically how uncertainty in the upstream components of a phylogenetic analysis such as assembly and homology affect uncertainty in the downstream components such as gene trees and species trees. My resume is available [here](aguang.github.io/public-resume.pdf "resume").

When I'm not working on my dissertation, I coordinate QT (Queer & Trans) Thursdays at the [Providence Youth Student Movement (PrYSM)](http://prysm.us), a weekly space for queer youth of color.
